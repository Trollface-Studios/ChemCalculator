# ChemCalculator v1.0
Chemical reactions &amp; compounds calculator project.
-----
This is a project we did initially as part of the IB's CAS programme, but then mostly because we found it fun. It currently enables you to calculate a lot of things chemistry related - albeit not overly complex stuff - and we believe it can be helpful to many students like us, whether it be for homework, entertainment or w/e. Enjoy!

##Functions

* Calculate tons of different chemical equations (supports multiple modes for each equation)
* Display the Periodic Table of Elements with info on each one

Currently the data is there about each element and its properties, but the app doesn't know how to use the data well yet.

##Possible future functionality
* Calculate data about a single compound
* Equation balancing
* Display extensive data about an element
* Detect the Exit button clicks better (:D)

##Download & Usage 
* Requires java 1.7+ to run
* [**v1.0 DOWNLOAD**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ofc6tgjukbquo13/ChemCalculator%20v1.0.rar?dl=0)
* To launch ChemCalculator, download the .rar, extract it and run ChemCalculator.bat
